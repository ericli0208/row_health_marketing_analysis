# Row Health Marketing Insights
## About Row Health
**Founded in 2016, Row Health is a medical insurance company serving thousands of customers throughout the United States**. **In 2019, they launched a new set of marketing campaign categories** spanning topics like wellness tips, the affordability of their plans, and preventative care. Their customers can sign up for 4 different plans - bronze, silver, gold, and platinum - each with different premiums and claim coverage rates. 

Now that they’ve hired a new data team and are strategizing their marketing budget for 2024, the company would like to build more understanding of the effectiveness of these campaign categories and how they relate to signups and subsequent patient claims. The budget is allocated to drive two primary objectives: 1) to increase the number of customer signups, and 2) to raise awareness of Row Health’s brand across the country.

## Data Structure
The dataset consisted of three tables, including information about campaigns, signups and user demographics, as well as claims filed by customers and related claim information.
